/*interface is a definition of a part of a class
* tell you what a class /object can do
* object can access other object through their interfaces
* very smaller to abstract class
* can have method without implementation(just definition),method with implementation
* can be used as variable type
*
* a class can implement multiple interface
* an interface has no constructor
* an interface can implement methods but doesn't need to
* an interface can not initialize value but can update them
* an interface can inherit from another interface   */
