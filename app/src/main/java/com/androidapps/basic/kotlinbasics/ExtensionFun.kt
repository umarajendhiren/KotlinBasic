/*if we wants to add new function to the existing class there is two way available.
*  in java  one is we need to add function with in the same  class
*  or if we want to add outside of class we need to extend that class then we can add whatever we want in subclass.that is inheritance concept.
* in kotlin we can add function for existing class (outside the class) without inheriting them.that is extension function
* To add an extension function to a class, define a new function appended to the classname
*
*  By defining an extension, you are not inserting new members into a class,
* only making new functions callable with the dot-notation on variables of this type.
*
* 1.if member function and extension function has same signature like same name and parameter ,kotlin compiler will omit extension function and call member function only.
* because by default kotlin compiler look for member function first ,if it is not there then only it looks for extension function.
