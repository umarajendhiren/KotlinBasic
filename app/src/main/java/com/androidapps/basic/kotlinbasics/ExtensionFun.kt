/*if we wants to add new function to the existing class there is two way available.
*  in java  one is we need to add function with in the same  class
*  or if we want to add outside of class we need to extend that class then we can add whatever we want in subclass.that is inheritance concept.
* in kotlin we can add function for existing class (outside the class) without inheriting them.that is extension function
* To add an extension function to a class, define a new function appended to the classname
*
*  By defining an extension, you are not inserting new members into a class,
* only making new functions callable with the dot-notation on variables of this type.
*
* 1.if member function and extension function has same signature like same name and parameter ,kotlin compiler will omit extension function and call member function only.
* because by default kotlin compiler look for member function first ,if it is not there then only it looks for extension function.

/*3.Nullable Receiver â€“
Extension functions can also be defined with the class type that is nullable.
In this case, when the check for null is added inside the extension function and the appropriate value is returned

/*
class AB(val name: String){
    override fun toString(): String {
        return "Name is $name"

    fun AB?.output(){

        }else{
            println(this.toString())

    val x = AB("Charchit")

    // Extension function called using an instance
    x.output()
    // Extension function called on null
    null.output()
}

/*4.Just like the calling of regular member function of the companion object,
 extension function can be called using only the class name as the qualifier*/


class MyClass {
    companion object {
        // member function of companion object
