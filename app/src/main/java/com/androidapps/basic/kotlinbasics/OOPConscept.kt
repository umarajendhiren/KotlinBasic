/*inheritance:
* classes can inherit methods and parameter from other classes
* to make a class inheritable ,we need to use open keyword followed by class name
* if parent class has more constructors ,at least one must be initialised when we inherit
* ex:class Child:Parent()
* child class can override methods and variables in parent class using override keyword if they are marked as open
* child class can access parent class methods and variables using the super keyword
* in that way we can avoid more boilerplate code and duplication of code*/
